# Tic Tac Toe

A simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game where two players can compete on the same screen. The game automatically detects when a player wins or when the match ends in a draw.


## Description
This project is a lightweight implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features an intuitive interface and responsive design for seamless play on desktop or mobile browsers.

The logic behind the game checks for winning conditions dynamically after every move, ensuring fair play and immediate feedback. The game also provides a restart option to play multiple rounds without reloading the page.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay (Player X vs Player O)
- Automatic win/draw detection
- Restart option
- Clean and responsive UI

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – for the page structure  
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – for the game logic and interactivity

## Project Challenges
One of the main challenges was implementing the winning condition detection logic. This was solved by defining all possible win combinations and checking them dynamically after each turn.
